# Advent Of Code 2024

This is my repository for the advent of code 2024 using the **Elixir** language

## What is Advent of Code ?

The Advent of Code is an annual coding event that takes place every December, starting on December 1st and running until December 25th. It features a series of daily programming puzzles designed to test problem-solving skills and creativity. Created by Eric Wastl, the event caters to programmers of all skill levels and is celebrated for its engaging and festive themes.

Each day, a new two-part puzzle is unlocked, and participants solve it using their preferred programming language. Solutions are submitted for points, and a leaderboard fosters friendly competition among individuals and teams. It's also a popular way to practice coding, learn new languages or tools, and join a global community of developers during the holiday season.

## This repository

For every page in the **lib/** folder there is a dedicated README for every day in the AOC. And in each folder contains the documentated functions explaining what was done to solve each problem.
